            <h3>The definition of 'private'... in some way.</h3>
            <p>PornHubOS (also known as PornAOSP or PAOSP) is an Android distribution focused around privacy when doing... ermmmm... certain activities.</p>

            <p>PornAOSP is designed with simplicity, privacy and ease of use in mind. Based on LineageOS, it brings the finest stability and greatest features to the user.</p>
            <p>Focused on improving what we see as the greatest features of Android and not sophisticating things, PornAOSP provides a smooth user experience with many intuitive customization options to satisfy your tinkering needs.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Wait... what?</h3>
            <p>What? Porn? An OS? How's it even possible?</p>
            <p>Looks fake, huh? Let me show you how wrong you are. It's actually being developed, <a href="https://github.com/PAOSP">and you can see the sources here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>This project started as a joke on a Polish Redmi Note 4 users group (not available anymore). Someone managed to post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/memes.xda/photos/a.559006140857263.1073741830.445311248893420/1486719024752632/?type=3&theater">a fake screenshot</a> of <em>PornHubOS</em> running on a Redmi Note 4 to <a href="https://t.me/rn4official">@rn4official</a>. It was met with great enthusiasm, and even greater expectations. So, while it was going viral, we thought "Why not make it a reality?". And thus PornAOSP was born.</p>
            <p>We created a Telegram group to share or project to the world, which grew to <strong>250 members</strong> within a few hours. It also managed to run through a few of spam attacks, but that's a story for another day.</p>
            <p>After some time we considered the issue of the PornHub trademark. We managed to release one build with PornHubOS name, but later ones will be branded <strong>PornAOSP</strong>. We strongly believe that name is much more neutral. We don't wish to risk a copyright abuse. <strong>However, the final name could change.</strong></p>

            <h3>Downloads</h3>

            <p>Sadly, we haven't got any release which is ready to share. Yet.<br>Although, the Nougat edition is really close to be released! Stay tuned!</p>
            
            <p>This is a purely hobbyst project and we don't set any deadlines. We're doing what we want to do and experimenting with the project.</p>
            <p>The first build will be released for <a href="http://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/xiaomi/redminote4snapdragon/">Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Snapdragon (mido)</a>. We're also planning to release it for <a href="http://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/xiaomi/mi4lte/">Mi 4 (cancro)</a>, but that build will be much later down the line. We're not planning any other official ports right now.</p>
            <p>Please don't ask us for ETAs - we don't know! It'll be released when we think it's stable enough. <strong>We can promise you that every ETA question makes the project release date postpone. Consider that.</strong></p>
