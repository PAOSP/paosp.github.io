            <h3>The definition of private... in some way.</h3>
            <p>PornHubOS (also known as PornAOSP or PAOSP) is an Android distribution focused privacy when doing... eeeem... certain things.</p>

            <p>PornAOSP is designed with simplicity and user experience in mind. Based on LineageOS, it's build the finest stability and greatest features to the user.</p>
            <p>Focused on improving what's greatest in Android and not sophisticating things, PornAOSP provides smooth user experience with great customization options left to end user.</p>

            <h3>Wait... what?</h3>
            <p>It looks fake to you, right? Well, you're wrong. It's actually real. <a href="https://github.com/PAOSP">And you can see the sources here.</a></p>
            
            <p>This project started as a joke on a Polish Redmi Note 4 users group (not availible anyway). One guy managed to post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/memes.xda/photos/a.559006140857263.1073741830.445311248893420/1486719024752632/?type=3&theater">a fake screenshot</a> of it running to <a href="https://t.me/rn4official">@rn4official</a> and it was greeted with great enthusiasm, and even greater expectations. So, while it was getting viral, we thought "Why not make it an actual ROM?". That's how the whole story started.</p>
            <p>Our Telegram group built instantly, and grew to 250 members within a few hours. It also managed to run through a few of attacks within that period, but it's a longer story :v</p>
            <p>After some time we considered the fact of using PornHub trademark. We managed to release one build with PornHubOS name, but later ones will be branded <strong>PornAOSP</strong>. We strongly believe that name is much more neutral. We don't want to risk a copyright abuse. <strong>However, the final name may change.</strong></p>

            <h3>OK... When?</h3>

            <p>We can't tell you the exact ETA. We don't know when the first build will be finished.</p>
            
            <p>This is a for-fun project and we don't care about any deadlines. We're doing what we want to do and experimenting with the project.</p>
            <p>The first build will be released for <a href="http://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/xiaomi/redminote4snapdragon/">Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Snapdragon (mido)</a>. We're also planning to release it for <a href="http://www.gsmchoice.com/en/catalogue/xiaomi/mi4lte/">Mi 4 (cancro)</a>, but a build for it will be released much later. We're not planning any other official ports right now.</p>
            <p>Please don't ask us for ETAs. It'll be released when we think it's stable enough. <strong>We can promise you that every ETA question makes the project release date postpone. Consider that.</strong></p>
